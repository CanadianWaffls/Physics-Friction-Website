                    How do Cars Work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To understand how tires use friction to make vehicles move,
                     we must understand the basics of how cars move. Car 
                     engines use a piston to apply force to a crankshaft which
                      turns the axles of the car. The axel spins the wheels and
                       by extension the tires which then push against the ground
                        to move the car forward (Karroll & Karroll, 2024).

                <h3>Where do Tires Come in?</h3>
                <p>
                    Newton's third law states that for every action there is an
                     equal and opposite reaction (Newton's third law of Motion)
                      Because of this, when the tires push against the ground, 
                      the ground pushes against the tire with the same amount of
                       force. Newton's second law states that the net force of 
                       an object is proportional to the acceleration and inversely
                        proportional to the mass (Elert). Because the ground has 
                        more mass than a car the net force of the ground is 
                        miniscule compared to that of the car so the car will 
                        move. Because the ground is pushing in the opposite 
                        direction of the tires, that is where the direction of the
                         net force of the car will be.

                <h3>How are tires affected by friction?</h3>
                <p>
                    Friction is a force that acts on surfaces that are sliding 
                    or rolling against each other (Friction 2024). When a car's
                     tires push against the ground it is the force of friction
                      between the ground and the tires that push the car 
                      forward. Every surface has friction however tires are 
                      designed to amplify this friction so that the car can 
                      more easily move itself forward. This added friction is 
                      also what allows cars to brake so easily compared to 
                      other vehicles with wheels. Since cars have so much 
                      friction when there is no longer a force applied friction 
                      becomes the only force acting in the x direction 
                      (horizontal) and so the car uses up this remaining 
                      frictional force until it comes to a stop.

                    <h2>Tread Pattern</h2>
                    <p>Tread patterns on tires are important because 
                        the irregular shape of the grooves create more 
                        points of contact with the ground that generates 
                        more friction (Karroll, 2024).

                    <p>
                        The materials that are used in a tire can impact its
                        friction. Most tires use a soft rubber because it 
                        conforms to the rough surface of the road and creates
                         more points of contact, thus more friction 
                         (Karroll, 2024).

                    <p>
                        Low tire pressure causes the tire walls to flex which 
                        pulls the tire tread to lift away from the road leaving 
                        less points of contact. Tire pressure must also stay low
                         enough that the width of the tire stays on the road as 
                         excessive pressure causes the center of the tire tread 
                         to take most of the load (Karroll, 2024).

            <h1>Too Much Friction</h1>
            <p>Although friction is crucial to the function of tires, if the force 
                applied by the vehicle cannot overcome the static friction of the tires
                 against the ground it will not move. Also, as tires move across the ground,
                  they are damaged by constant friction. This is why we do not use snow tires
                   for the entire year, as the extra friction causes extra damage to the tires 
                   and may cause difficulty with static friction in high friction driving 
                   environments.
