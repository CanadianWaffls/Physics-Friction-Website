                    How do Cars Work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In order to understand how tires use friction to move cars,
                    we must first understand the basics of how cars move in the first place.
                    An internal combustion engine takes in gasoline, compresses the gasoline with the air,
                    it then ignites the gasoline and air mixture causing an explosion,
                        the car uses this explosion to push a piston downwards with lots of force.
                        This force is transferred through the crankshaft and turns the axle(s)
                        with the wheels attached and the tires on the wheels push against the ground
                        to move the car<p class="citationNeeded">(citation needed)</p>.

                <h3>Where do Tires Come in?</h3>
                <p>
                    Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction 
                    <p class="citationNeeded">(citation needed)</p>. Because of this, when the tires push 
                    against the ground, the ground pushes against the tire with the same amount of force. 
                    Newton's second law states that the net force of an object is proportional to the 
                    acceleration and inversely proportional to the mass 
                    <p class="citationNeeded">(citation needed)</p>. Because the ground has more mass 
                    than a car the net force of the ground is miniscule compared to that of the car so 
                    the car will move. Because the ground is pushing in the opposite direction of the tires,
                     that is where the direction of the net force of the car will be.

                <h3>How are tires affected by friction?</h3>
                <p>
                    Friction is a force that acts on surfaces that are sliding or rolling against each other 
                    <p class="citationNeededM">(citation may be needed)</p>. When a car's tires push against 
                    the ground it is the force of friction between the ground and the tires that push the car 
                    forward. Every surface has friction however tires are designed to amplify this friction so 
                    that the car can more easily move itself forward. This added friction is also what allows cars 
                    to brake so easily compared to other vehicles with wheels. Since cars have so much friction when 
                     there is no longer a force applied friction becomes the only force acting in the x 
                     direction (horizontal) and so the car uses up this remaining frictional force until 
                     it comes to a stop.
