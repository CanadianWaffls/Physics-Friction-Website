                    How do Cars Work?

                <p>
                    In order to understand how tires use friction to move cars,
                    we must first understand the basics of how cars move in the first place.
                    An internal combustion engine takes in gasoline, compresses the gasoline with the air,
                    it then ignites the gasoline and air mixture causing an explosion,
                        the car uses this explosion to push a piston downwards with lots of force.
                        This force is transferred through the crankshaft and turns the axle(s)
                        with the wheels attached and the tires on the wheels push against the ground
                        to move the car. <p class="citationNeeded">(citation needed)</p>
